# loan-repayment-prediction
Project Description :

Data-driven "Loan Repayment Prediction" project's primary objective is to enhance lending institutions' loan application evaluation processes. The purpose of this project is to create a prediction model that can exactly predict whether a borrower will successfully repay their loan by using advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques.
                    In order to achieve , this project draws on historical loan data as primary source of the insights. Information in the dataset is to train , test and validate machine learning model. And this model is designed to categorize loan applicants into two classes those who repay the loan and those who may pose a risk.

                                                                         The project includes several important parts, such as feature engineering, model building, data preprocessing, and model evaluation. Encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and resolving missing data are examples of data preparation tasks. By adding new features, feature engineering goes beyond the initial dataset and could improve the predictive ability of the model. These aspects might include looking into credit history trends, assessing work histories, and obtaining geographic information from addresses.
